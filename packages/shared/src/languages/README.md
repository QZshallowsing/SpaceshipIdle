## Add A New Language

Please join Discord channel (https://discord.com/invite/Z3kFpawyts) and ping **@FishPond**. I will create a new language template for you

## Checks Have Failed

Don't worry. The CI checks are mainly designed for source code - it is most likely complaining about formatting. If you have only touched language files, just ignore the check, I will manually fix the format
